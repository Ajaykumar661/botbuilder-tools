# **LUBuild**
The **LUBuild** tool makes it easy for you to manage working with multiple model definitions among team members across data centers and languages.

For each LU file (and its language variants) **LUBuild** will do the following:

1. If there isn't a LUIS AppId for the model, it will create one
2. It runs ludown tool to generate the model
3. It uploads the model to the appid as a new versionId (incremented)
4. It trains the version of the model 
5. It publishes the version as the new model
6. (OPTIONAL) It deletes the old version
7. (OPTIONAL) It outputs a .dialog definition of a LuisRecognizer configured to use that model.

## Installation

**LUBuild** is not currently available for installation

## Usage

1. Create a luconfig.json with **name** and **models** configured to your root .LU files
2. Get LUIS.ai authoringKey
3. Invoke `lubuild --authoringKey YOURKEY`

> NOTE: `--authoringKey` is not needed if you have LUIS_AUTHORING_KEY environment variable or a .luisrc file with the authoringKey in it

**LUBuild** will create all of the assets you need from your local .LU files

### Adding and removing LU files from your luconfig.json
You can use **lubuild add** and **lubuild remove** to easily add/remove a .lu file to your luconfig.json models

```bash
lubuild add file.lu
```

## LU and language variations files
Every LU file can have multiple language variations.  **LUBuild** will build a model for each one.  

The pattern for .LU files and the language variants are

```
example.en-us.lu
example.fr-fr.lu
example.de-de.lu
etc.
````

Each one of these .lu files will have a language specific model created for it.

## LUIS Applications 

Every combination of project, environment, and file name (with locale) will be used to name the application created on your behalf.

LUIS application names will use this format:

> {projectname}-{environment}-{LUfilename}

Example:

```
MyProject(tomlm)-Contoso.GetAddresss.en-us.lu
MyProject(tomlm)-Contoso.GetAddresss.fr-fr.lu
MyProject(tomlm)-Contoso.GetAddresss.de-de.lu
```

The same application name will be used in each azure region, with endpoints internal to it.

## Environments

When multiple people are working with models you want to be able to work with models
independently from each other tied to the source control.

By default, **LUBuild** uses the logged in user alias as the environment, so that you can
simply create and work with local changes.  

The environment is placed in the *settings.luis.environment* configuration to control which
actual application ids you are connected to.

You can override the environment via cli argument *--environment foo* or via the luconfig.json
file.

## Config file
The **luconfig.json** file describes the configuration for **LUBuild**.  Any LU files added to this file 
will be processed by **LUBuild** to create the published models you need to execute against.

```json
{
    "name":"MyProject",
    "defaultLanguage":"en-us",
    "models": [
        "test/test.lu",
        "test/sample/x/Contoso.Foo.lu"
    ]
}
```

Every .LU file which is added to the models collection will be processed by **LUBuild**.

| properties      |            | description                                                                                           |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| models          | (required) | collection of paths to .lu files and language variants                                                |
| name            | (required) | project name                                                                                          |
| folder          |            | alternate folder to place generated .dialog files                                                     |
| environment     |            | environment to target (see environments section)                                                      |
| authoringRegion |            | authoring region to use [westus,westeurope,australiaeast]                                             |
| defaultLanguage |            | configures default language model to use if there is no culture code in the file name (Default:en-us) |

All command line args can be placed in the config file, and vice versa, except for the **models** collection itself

## Generated Settings file
The output of LUBuild includes a settings file per environment which contains the mapping of lu file variants to the LUIS applicationID for the model.

Example for user **tomlm** targeting authoring region **westus** 

**luis.settings.tomlm.westus.json**

```json
{
    "luis": {
        "test_de-de_lu": "55297226-b21c-4bf2-8ec0-eaf582635146",
        "test_fr-fr_lu": "dcb79070-7ff0-4937-89f4-f7f83512cae5",
        "test_en-us_lu": "537d1328-8eba-4067-8dfd-8edb95cb9525",
        "Contoso_Foo_es-es_lu": "9104b91d-86cd-4038-9e81-1af3660b872b",
        "Contoso_Foo_fr-fr_lu": "43d3aa8d-2027-40bd-978d-630fa3490033",
        "Contoso_Foo_ko-kr_lu": "37c9a32e-dbca-4632-8b4d-a9da533b8fa6",
        "Contoso_Foo_en-us_lu": "9347b984-6206-467d-abdf-7ad78284d060"
    }
}
```

## Generated .Dialog file for each lu file

All language variations of a .LU files with the same prefix will get a .dialog file created
which is a LUIS recognizer configured for it. 

Example:

```
models/tomlm/westus/Contoso.GetAddresss.lu.dialog <-- MultiLanguageRecognizer configured to use all of the languages 
models/tomlm/westus/Contoso.GetAddresss.en-us.lu.dialog <-- LuisRecognizer 
models/tomlm/westus/Contoso.GetAddresss.fr-fr.lu.dialog <-- LuisRecognizer 
models/tomlm/westus/Contoso.GetAddresss.de-de.lu.dialog <-- LuisRecognizer 
```

The net result is that to consume all of the language models in a dialog you simply can do this:

```json
{
    "$type":"Microsoft.AdaptiveDialog",
    "recognizer": "Contoso.GetAddresss.lu"  <-- this will be the multilanguage model with all variations
}
```

This will configure your recognizer to a LURecognizer("Contsoso.GetAddresss.lu") which internally
will use your memory *settings.luis.projectname* and *settings.luis.environment* settings to
bind to the correct .dialog file for your model and runtime environment.
