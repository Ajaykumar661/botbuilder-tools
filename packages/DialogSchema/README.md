# DialogSchema Command Line tool

DialogSchema tool is a command line tool designed to merge together Microsoft Bot Builder](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder) .schema JSON schema files into a single JSON schema file. You can point to the files either directly with a glob pattern or indirectly through a glob pattern that matches a package.json, packages.config or *.csproj file.  The .schema files should have a unique filename that is used to refer to that type using `$type`.  The .schema files can optionally include a `$schema: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/SchemaGen/packages/DialogSchema/src/dialogSchema.schema"` which defines the schema they are validated against.  Within a schema definition you can use `$role:"unionType(<type>)` to project the type definition into union types defined using `$role:"unionType"` while merging.  To refer to a type in a property, just use `"$type":"<type>"`.  The merger combines all of the component .schema files into a single .schema file that has resolved all external `$ref`, merged `allOf` and connected together schemas through `$role` and `$type`. 

In addition all .lg files that share a location and name with .schema files will be merged into a single global .lg file for each locale.  The naming pattern is `<type>[-<locale>].lg` found in the same location as `<type>.schema`.  If a global .lg file already exists then its template definitions will replace any associated with individual .schema files.  Any property marked with `$role:"lg"` will automatically be included as an empty template if not already defined in a .lg file.  

For example look at these files:
* [Microsoft.IRecognizer.schema](test/definitions/Microsoft.IRecognizer.schema) defines the place holder for `Microsoft.IRecognizer` including a default option which is a bare string.    
* [Microsoft.LUISRecognizer.schema](test/implementations/Microsoft.LUISRecognizer.schema) includes `"$implements":\["Microsoft.IRecognizer"\]` which extends the `Microsoft.IRecognizer` definition when merged.  [Microsoft.RegexRecognizer.schema](test/implementations/Microsoft.RegexRecognizer.schema) is another implementation.
* [Microsoft.Topic.schema](test/implementations/Microsoft.Topic.schema) is a schema file that includes `"$type":"Microsoft.IRecognizer"` in order to make use of the `Microsoft.IRecognizer` place holder. 
* [app.schema](test/examples/app.schema) was created by this tool shows how all of these defintions are merged together.  In particular if you look at `Microsoft.IRecognizer` you will see the definition that includes a string, or the complete definition of `Microsoft.LUISRecognizer` or `Microsoft.RegexRecognizer`.
* [Microsoft.Prompt-en-us.lg](test/examples/Microsoft.Prompt-en-us.lg) Shows some templates for a particular type.
* [app.lg](test/examples/app.lg) and [app-en-us.lg](test/examples/app-en-us.lg) show files generated by this tool.

[example.dialog](test/examples/example.dialog) Shows how you could use the resulting schema to enter in JSON schema and get intellisense.
